# truelayer-go
An unofficial TrueLayer SDK for Go

This SDK only has plans to support the TrueLayer Data API

## Usage
An example of how to use the truelayer-go SDK can be found in the 
[examples](examples/) directory.

The README will be updated to include more in-depth usage instructions soon.

## Supported Providers
truelayer-go doesn't inherently limit the providers that can be used however, 
the SDK does provide hard-coded provider values to make it easier to manage.

The hard-coded providers can be found under 
[truelayer/providers](truelayer/providers/).
